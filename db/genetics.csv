molecular biology,the branch of biology that studies the structure and activity of macromolecules essential to life (and especially with their genetic role)
bacteriophages,viruses that infect bacteria
nucleotides,Basic units of DNA molecule, composed of a sugar, a phosphate, and one of 4 DNA bases
dna polymerase,enzyme involved in DNA replication that joins individual nucleotides to produce a DNA molecule
dna ligase,an enzyme that eventually joins the sugar-phosphate backbones of the Okazaki fragments
transcripition,process by which a DNA template is used to produce a single-stranded RNA molecule
rna polymerase,enzyme similar to DNA polymerase that binds to DNA and separates the DNA strands during transcription
promoter,region of DNA that indicates to an enzyme where to bind to make RNA
introns,a non-coding, intervening sequence within a eukaryotic gene
exons,expressed sequence of DNA; codes for a protein
rna splicing,process by which the introns are removed from RNA transcripts and the remaining exons are joined together
anticodon,group of three bases on a tRNA molecule that are complementary to an mRNA codon
mutagen,any agent (physical or environmental) that can induce a genetic mutation or can increase the rate of mutation
lytic cycle,a viral reproductive cycle in which copies of a virus are made within a host cell, which then bursts open, releasing new viruses
lysogenic cycle,a viral reproductive cycle in which the viral DNA is added to the host cell's DNA and is copied along with the host cell's DNA
retrovirus,any of a group of viruses that contain two single-strand linear RNA molecules per virion and reverse transcriptase (RNA to DNA)
